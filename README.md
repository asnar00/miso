# miso

`miso` ("make it so") is a line of experiments exploring the concept of *feature-modular specifications* as a useful representation of programs.

Each new experiment starts "from scratch" or builds on a previous experiment; previous experiments are stored in branches and the main branch is always cleared for new experiments.
