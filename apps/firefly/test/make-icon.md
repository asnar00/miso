# make-icon
*generates the app icon for the test application*

The test application uses a custom app icon showing the nøøb logo `ᕦ(ツ)ᕤ` on a turquoise background (RGB: 64, 224, 208).

The icon is generated programmatically to ensure proper rendering of Unicode characters, particularly the Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics characters used for the "arms".

The icon is 1024x1024 pixels, with the logo rendered in Helvetica at 225pt, centered on the turquoise background.
