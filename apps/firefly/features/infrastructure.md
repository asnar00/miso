*foundational systems that support feature development and deployment*

Infrastructure provides the essential plumbing that makes Firefly work: communication with servers, debugging tools, local persistent storage, and automated testing.

These features aren't visible to end users but are critical for development, debugging, and ensuring the app works reliably.
