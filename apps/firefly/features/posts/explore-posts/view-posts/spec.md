# view posts
*display a list of posts in a scrollable feed with images and formatted text*

This component displays any list of posts as a scrolling feed against a tunable background color (default black, configurable via background-colour-r/g/b tunables).

Each post appears in a white card with slightly rounded corners and a subtle shadow. The cards are spaced comfortably apart so you can easily tell where one ends and the next begins.

When the list is first opened, all posts are in compact form; tapping a compact post expands it.
