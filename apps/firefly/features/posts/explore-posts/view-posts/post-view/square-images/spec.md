# square images
*all images display as squares, regardless of original shape*

When viewing a post, the image always appears as a square, filling the full width of the post. This creates a consistent, clean visual rhythm as you scroll through posts.

**How it works:**

For portrait images (taller than wide), we show the middle portion and hide the top and bottom edges. For landscape images (wider than tall), we show the middle portion and hide the left and right edges. The image is always centered within the square frame.

**What stays the same:**

- The original image is never modified or cropped permanently
- Tapping to zoom still shows the full original image
- Image quality remains unchanged
- Thumbnails in compact view remain square (as before)

**Why squares:**

Square images create visual consistency across all posts, regardless of how the original photo was taken. Portrait and landscape photos sit together naturally without jarring height differences as you scroll.
