# clip offset
*drag to reposition what's visible in the square frame*

When viewing an image in the square frame, you see the center portion by default. But sometimes the interesting part - a face, a detail - is off to one side.

**Adjusting the clip:**

While editing a post, drag on the image to reposition what's visible. The image slides under the square frame, letting you choose which portion to show. The movement is constrained so the image always fills the frame completely - you can't drag so far that empty space appears.

**What you can adjust:**

- Portrait images (taller than wide): Drag up/down to show more of the top or bottom
- Landscape images (wider than tall): Drag left/right to show more of the left or right side
- Square images: No adjustment needed - the whole image is visible

**Saving your choice:**

When you save the post, your clip position is remembered. Everyone who views the post sees it framed the way you intended.

**Default position:**

New images start centered. If you don't adjust, the middle portion shows - same as before this feature existed.
