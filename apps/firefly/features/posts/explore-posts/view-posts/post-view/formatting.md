*visual spacing, sizing, and styling for post view elements*

Post views have a clean, readable layout with carefully balanced spacing and typography that works in both compact and expanded states.

**Text sizing:**
- Post titles appear at 24 points in bold in both compact and expanded states
- Summaries use 14 points in italic style
- Body text (expanded only) flows at standard reading size
- Section headings within body text appear at 18 points in bold
- Metadata (author, location, date) uses 12 points at 60% opacity for subtle emphasis

**Spacing:**
- Post views sit 8 points apart from each other in the list
- Inside each view, elements have 8 points of breathing room
- Images (thumbnails in compact, full-size in expanded) get 8 points of padding above and below
- Body text has 8 points of space before the metadata line

**Thumbnails (compact state):**
- Square thumbnails are 80x80 pixels
- Positioned on the right side of the view
- Text wraps around the thumbnail

**Images (expanded state):**
- Full-width images with aspect ratio preserved
- 12-point rounded corners to match the view's rounded corners

**View appearance:**
- Post views have 12-point rounded corners with a subtle 2-point shadow
- White background at 90% opacity creates comfortable reading surfaces

The turquoise background (#40E0D0) provides a distinctive brand color. All spacing values are consistent to create visual rhythm throughout the feed.
