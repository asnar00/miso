# toolbar
*a small set of buttons, always present*

The `toolbar` is a small horizontal strip at the bottom of the screen; it stays on the screen and draws on top of whatever content is below it (the post explorer).

The toolbar has four buttons, as follows:

"home" - jumps to the current "most recent posts" view. Icon is a "house" icon.

"post" - make a new post in the current list. Icon is a "+".

"search" - jump to a semantic search page (tbd). Icon is a "magnifying glass".

"profile" - explore the main profile post for the current user. Icon is a silhouette of a person.

At all times, one of the four buttons (the last one we pressed - default "home") is highlighted (using a gray rounded surrounding square) to indicate which "view" we're in.
