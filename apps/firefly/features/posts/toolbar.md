# toolbar
*a sleek rounded button strip, always present*

The `toolbar` is a sleek rounded lozenge at the bottom of the screen; it floats above the content with a subtle shadow, creating a modern, polished appearance.

**Visual Design:**
- Rounded lozenge shape (25pt corner radius)
- Light grey background (RGB 0.7, 0.7, 0.7)
- Maximum width of 300pt, centered on screen
- Strong shadow for depth (40% black opacity, 12pt blur, 4pt downward offset)
- Positioned 12pt from bottom edge, nestled in the screen curve

The toolbar has three buttons:

- **"make post"** (speech bubble icon) : shows all recent posts from all users, with a "create post" button at the top

- **"search"** (magnifying glass icon) : shows the current user's most recent queries, with a "create query" button at the top

- **"users"** (two people icon) : shows a list of all users in the system

Each button highlights when active with a darker grey background (50% grey opacity) for clear visual feedback.
