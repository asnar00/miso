# toolbar
*a small set of buttons, always present*

The `toolbar` is a small horizontal strip at the bottom of the screen; it stays on the screen and draws on top of whatever content is below it (the post explorer).

The toolbar has three buttons, as follows:

- "make post" (a "speech bubble" icon) : shows a list of the current user's most recent posts, with a "create post" button at the top

- "search" (a "magnifying class" icon) : shows a list of the current user's most recent queries, with a "create query" button at the top

- "users" (a "two people" icon) : shows a list of users - currently just "all users in the system"
