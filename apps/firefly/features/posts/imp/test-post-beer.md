*the drink that dare not speak its name*

Ah, craft beer. As a wise man once said, "Alcohol is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy." 

Or, as Homer Simpson once memorably eulogised it: "The cause of, and answer to, all of life's problems". 

Especially Belgian beer, for some reason. Is there anything you can't do, Belgian Trappist Monks?

It's my contention that a great deal of the trouble in the world could be avoided if people just sat down together once in a while and had a couple of jars.

Maybe there's something in that.
