*display recent posts in a scrollable feed with images and formatted text*

When you open Firefly after signing in, you see a scrolling list of recent posts against a bright turquoise background.

Each post appears in a white card with slightly rounded corners and a subtle shadow. The cards are spaced comfortably apart so you can easily tell where one ends and the next begins.

Inside each card:

- The **title** appears at the top in large, bold text
- Below that is the *summary* in smaller italic text
- If the post has an image, it appears next with nicely rounded corners
- The main body text follows, with proper formatting:
  - Headings appear larger and bold
  - Bullet points show as actual bullets (") with proper indentation
  - Paragraphs flow naturally with appropriate spacing
  - Image references in the text are hidden (they'd be redundant since the image is already showing)

At the bottom of each card you'll find:

- Location tag (if the author added one)
- Date and time when the post was created
- An "AI Generated" badge with a sparkle icon if the post was created by AI

The feed automatically loads the 50 most recent posts when you open it. If there's a problem loading posts, you'll see an error message with a retry button. While posts are loading, a spinner appears.

The whole design is clean and focused on readability, with generous whitespace and a careful balance between the different elements. The spacing between title, summary, image, and body text is tuned so nothing feels cramped or too spread out.
