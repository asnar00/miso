# create post
*make a new post*

This creates a new post in the database, populated with title, summary, image (if required), and body text. It should also set the author (by email address), and the current timezone, local time, and location.

When creating a child post (a post that belongs to another post), you can optionally provide the parent post's ID to link them together in the tree structure.
