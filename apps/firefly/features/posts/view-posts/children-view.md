# children view
*navigate to see all replies to a post*

When you tap the arrow button on a post that has children, you navigate to a full-screen view showing all the children of that post.

At the top of the screen, you'll see "children of {parent title}" so you know which post you're exploring.

The children are displayed just like in the main feed - each in its own card, newest first, with all the same features: you can tap to expand, read the full content, and see if they have their own children (indicated by the arrow button).

From this view, you can also create new child posts by tapping the "new post" button. Any post you create here automatically becomes a child of the parent post.

When you go back to the parent view, you'll return to exactly where you were - the parent post stays expanded and in view.
