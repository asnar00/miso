# formatting
*visual spacing, sizing, and styling for post display elements*

Post cards have a clean, readable layout with carefully balanced spacing and typography.

**Text sizing:**
- Post titles appear at 24 points in bold when expanded, 20 points when collapsed
- Summaries use 14 points in italic style
- Body text flows at standard reading size
- Section headings within posts appear at 18 points in bold
- Metadata (location, date) uses 12 points at 60% opacity for subtle emphasis

**Spacing:**
- Cards sit 8 points apart from each other
- Inside each card, elements have 8 points of breathing room
- Images get 8 points of padding above and below, matching the spacing to other sections
- Body text has 8 points of space before the metadata line

**Rounding and shadows:**
- Cards have 12-point rounded corners with a subtle 2-point shadow
- Images inside cards also use 12-point rounded corners to match

The turquoise background (#40E0D0) provides a distinctive brand color, while white cards at 90% opacity create comfortable reading surfaces. All spacing values are consistent to create visual rhythm throughout the feed.
