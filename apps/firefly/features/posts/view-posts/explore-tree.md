# explore tree
*how we navigate around trees of posts*

When viewing a post in expanded size, if that post has children, we should see a little button (white, circular) containing a "right-pointing arrow" icon, positioned on the right border of the post's container lozenge (i.e. overlapping the background colour a bit). It should be centered vertically relative to the post's container region.

Pressing this button should do nothing for now, other than call a dummy "view-children" function that spits something to the console.
