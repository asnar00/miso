# compact view
*minimise a post to just title / pic*

The compact view of a post shows the title, the one-line summary just below it, and (if there is one) the image from the post, aligned to the right hand side of the view, in a "lozenge" with rounded corners like normal posts.

The purpose is that we can quickly scan down a list of posts, and expand the ones we want to read.

The view-posts page starts with the first post in normal view, with subsequent posts in compact view.

Tapping on a compact-view expands it into a full view, using animation; conversely, tapping on the full-size view collapses it down to compact-view.

Only one post in a list can be expanded; expanding a post compacts the previous one, and scrolls to the start of the new post.
