*navigate through the tree of posts and their children*

Posts can have children, forming a tree structure. Users can navigate into child posts to explore deeper levels of the conversation.

**Visual Indicator**: Posts with children show a white chevron (right arrow) with a black outline on their right edge. The arrow sits across the edge of the post card.

**Navigate to Children**: Swipe left on a post with children to navigate to a view showing all its child posts.

**Child Posts View**: Shows the child posts with a "Create a new post" button at the top. The navigation bar displays a white oval button with a left arrow and the parent post's title (e.g., "< test post").

**Navigate Back**: Either tap the back button or swipe right anywhere in the child view to return to the parent view.

**Multiple Levels**: You can navigate through multiple levels of the post tree. Each level shows its own back button with the parent's title.
