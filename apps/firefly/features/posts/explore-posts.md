*navigate through the tree of posts and their children*

Posts can have children, forming a tree structure. Users can navigate into child posts to explore deeper levels of the conversation.

**Visual Indicator**: Posts with children show a white circle (42 points diameter) with a black outline (3 points thick) containing a black chevron arrow (pointing right). The circle sits at the right edge of the post card, positioned 16 points off the edge so it straddles the boundary.

**Navigate to Children**: Swipe left on a post with children (at least 30 points of movement) to navigate to a view showing all its child posts.

**Child Posts View**: Shows the child posts. The navigation bar displays a white oval button with a left arrow (chevron) and the parent post's title, truncated to one line if needed (e.g., "< test post").

**Navigate Back**: Either tap the back button or swipe from the left edge of the screen to return to the parent view. Standard iOS back navigation works naturally.

**Scroll Position Preserved**: When you navigate from the main posts list to view children, then return, your scroll position is preserved exactly where you left it.

**Multiple Levels**: You can navigate through multiple levels of the post tree. Each level shows its own back button with the parent's title.
