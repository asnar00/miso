# ping
*check if the server is reachable from the client*

The `ping` feature allows the client app to check whether the server is running and accessible on the local network.

While the app is running and has focus, it sends a regular ping request to the server at a known IP address and port.

If the ping succeeds, the app is "connected", otherwise "disconnected".
