# posts
*the things users make and search for*

`posts` are the basic unit of content in firefly. A post is a short markdown file with the following properties:

- # title
- *one-line summary*
- (optional) a picture
- body text (up to 300 words or so)

Posts can be arranged into trees; each post has a parent, and a post can have multiple children.

Along with each post, we also store meta-data:

- date and time of post (UTC)
- local time (i.e. time zone)
- location tag (optional)
- author (user)
- whether generated by AI or not (important!)

The 'generated by AI' feature is important because sometimes we'll generate posts by collecting human-written posts into a group, and summarising them. It's important that users can tell which is which.
