# logging
*multi-level logging system*

Logging occurs at three levels:

## local

Local logging lets us debug connection issues that occurred on mobile devices in the past. Log messages are stored in a local on-device file.

## connected

Connected logging sends real-time log messages to the host mac laptop (via USB cable) so that we can view them in real time.

## remote

Assuming connection can be made to the server, logs are sent in real time to the server which stores them for real-time or future viewing.
