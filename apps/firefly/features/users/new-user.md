# new-user
*how we deal with new users*

The `new-user` page is shown just after the `sign-in` page. Its purpose is to welcome a new user to the app, and show them around. For the moment, it will just show the nøøb logo, and the word "welcome", followed by the email address.

At the bottom will a button called "get started" which will go to the main home page.
