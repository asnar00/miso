# profile
*a post about each user*

Every user has a *profile page* - the title is your name, the subtitle is your profession or mission (or whatever you want); then a photograph of yourself (optional), followed by up to 300 words of text where you can write whatever you want.

To get to your profile page, hit the "profile" button on the toolbar (the one that looks like the outline of a person).

The first time you hit the button, a new profile page is created that you can edit. Once you've written the page, you can edit it at any time by pressing the "edit" button (looks like a pen writing) that appears at the bottom right of the post.
