# miso

`miso` ("make it so") is a line of experiments exploring the idea of "modular specifications" - trees of short natural-language text snippets describing a program.

Each new experiment starts "from scratch" or builds on a previous experiment; previous experiments are stored in branches and the main branch is always cleared for new experiments.

## goals

- find better ways for users, engineers and agents to collaborate to build software
- create a "natural-language normal form" representation of programs
- consider this form as defining a *family of programs*, plus example working examples
- allow features to be added, removed, or modified by the user at any time
- output stable, predictable implementations of specs on any platform
- "lift" existing legacy implementations up into "normal form"
