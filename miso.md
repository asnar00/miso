# miso
*a system for natural language programming*

`miso` is a collection of tools and techniques to allow lay-people ("domain experts") without knowledge of programming languages, to create and maintain their own software tools.

`miso` specifies programs as trees of short natural-language text documents called "snippets"; and we use a set of Claude Code workflows to convert these specifications to running code. 

At all times, the specification is kept up-to-date so that the code can be re-built from scratch, or ported to multiple platforms and SDKs.
