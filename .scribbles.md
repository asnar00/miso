*stupid ideas / thoughts*

decisions on this one:

- A/B/C.md 
- A/B/C~ for meta stuff

nice because
- everything's visible
- you can totally copy trees around
- we can put feature-dependent code snippets there

using the term *storage* for file organisation;
using the term *howtos* for actions.

hm should I go singular... then it becomes an object!!

making an attempt to truly address the user.
-> trouble is you don't know who the user is.
=> if I make it for myself, it's going to be more complex
=> so I should always make it FOR MYSELF. rather than some imaginary other person.






------------------------------------

OK, random afternoon* background-level thoughts and feelings.
1- putting the experiments out on youtube is good.
2- we actually got somewhere with the previous experiments
3- we need tighter control over the low-level.

So what things do we know?

- it's possible to author apps across platforms
- need platform experts
- for sure, we need multiple communicating micro-agents

so here the ideas of *actions*, *tools* and *tasks* need to be clarified.

So I think rather than reifying the term "feature-modular", let's just call them snippets, and we're done.

We DO need to sort out the annoying list/ thing. I think the way we do it is:

    miso/tools.md                       # tools overview
    miso/tools/determinism.md           # sub-detail about tools
    misol/tools/all/hello.md            # hello world tool

action= "do a thing". these are natural-language-specified howtos.
tool= "bit of code". deterministic code, repeatable.
task= "a specific goal to be achieved."
plan= steps we're going to undertake

can tools call external APIs?
I think there should be a category difference. So I'd say, "no".

tools
actions

----------------------------------

definitely needs to be some work on "visibility"
-> seeing what the browser is doing
-> seeing console
-> seeing what a server is doing
-> etc.

-----------------------------------

first experiment failed: because "build" isn't a tool.
It SHOULD have made it call out to some agent stuff.
But it didn't. So we have to try again.

I wonder if we can self-critique... but can't be arsed.
Let's try again tomorrow.

-----------------------------------

"actions" - how to do things, step by step.
also a tree.

I guess we could also make "plans" for doing stuff.

They're all tree-docs.

-------------------------------------

ChatGPT much more verbose and "clever" than Claude, I don't understand it half the time.

Needs to be a firm boundary between "what the user wrote" and "what the agent wrote".

Maybe even something like "all agent-written files should be named starting with `~`"
