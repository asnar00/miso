# viewer
*elegant viewer for spec trees*

The `viewer` tool allows the user to read snippets and navigate through the snippet tree.

The viewer is designed to sit at the left edge of the screen (where a standard IDE's tree-view would go); it shows the markdown content, nicely rendered, and a clickable list of children snippets below it (each showing title and summary).

Navigation is done through clickable breadcrumbs at the top of the display.

The viewer is designed to work well in a narrow width, leaving lots of space for the actual target application.
