# link behavior
*intra-spec in-pane; external in new tab*

Link handling rules:

- Links to other snippets within `specs/` open in the viewer pane
- Absolute URLs or non-spec links open in a new browser tab/window
- Show external-link icon for out-of-spec links

Safety

- Apply URL sanitization; block javascript: and data: links
