# screen-capture
*mirroring and recording the iPhone screen on macOS*

Screen capture allows you to mirror your iPhone's display to a macOS window in real-time, useful for development, debugging, and creating demonstrations.

## QuickTime Player Method

The simplest approach uses **QuickTime Player**, which is built into macOS:

1. Connect iPhone via USB
2. Open QuickTime Player
3. File ‚Üí New Movie Recording
4. Click the dropdown arrow next to the record button
5. Select your iPhone from the camera list
6. The iPhone screen appears in a window

## Automated Script

The `mirror.sh` script automates this process:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Opens QuickTime Player with iPhone screen mirroring

DEVICE_ID=$(xcrun devicectl list devices | grep "available (paired)" | awk '{print $NF}' | tr -d '()')

if [ -z "$DEVICE_ID" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå No paired iPhone found"
    exit 1
fi

DEVICE_NAME=$(xcrun devicectl list devices | grep "available (paired)" | awk '{print $1}')
echo "üì± Found device: $DEVICE_NAME"
echo "ü™û Opening QuickTime Player for screen mirroring..."

open -a "QuickTime Player"
sleep 2

osascript <<EOF
tell application "QuickTime Player"
    activate
    new movie recording
end tell
EOF

echo "üì∫ QuickTime Player opened with Movie Recording"
echo "   Click the dropdown next to the record button"
echo "   Select: $DEVICE_NAME"
```

**Usage:**
```bash
cd ide/miso/platforms/ios/screen-capture/imp
./mirror.sh
```

**Note:** You still need to manually select your iPhone from the camera dropdown in QuickTime Player. This is a macOS limitation - the camera source cannot be automated via AppleScript.

## Alternative: Command-Line Screen Recording

For automated screen recording without GUI interaction, use `xcrun`:

```bash
# Start recording to a file
xcrun devicectl device screenshot --device <DEVICE_ID> screenshot.png

# For video recording (requires Xcode 15+)
xcrun xctrace record --device <DEVICE_ID> --template 'System Recording' --output recording.trace
```

However, **xcrun does not support live mirroring** - it only captures static screenshots or recordings to files.

## Limitations

- QuickTime mirroring requires manual camera source selection (cannot be fully automated)
- Command-line tools can capture/record but not mirror in real-time
- Third-party tools like Reflector or AirServer offer more automation but cost money

## Implementation

Working implementation in `screen-capture/imp/mirror.sh`
