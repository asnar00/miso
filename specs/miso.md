# miso
*a system for end-user natural language programming*

`miso` is a system that lets laypersons (domain experts) write and maintain their own software tools, using natural language.

`miso` represents programs as a tree of small markdown documents (like this one!) called *snippets* that specify behaviour. To add detail to a snippet, we create child snippets rather than edit the original.

`miso`'s goal is to allow users to create programs that are easy to read, understand, and maintain.
