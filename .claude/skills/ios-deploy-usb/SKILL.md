## ⚠️ DELEGATION REQUIRED

**This skill must be executed by the instruction-follower subagent.**

When you see this skill invoked, you MUST use the Task tool to delegate it:

```
Task(
    subagent_type="instruction-follower",
    description="[Brief 3-5 word description]",
    prompt="Follow the instructions in .claude/skills/ios-deploy-usb/skill.md to [complete task description]."
)
```

**DO NOT execute the instructions below directly.** The subagent will read this file and execute autonomously, then report back the results.

# iOS USB Deploy

## Overview

Builds an iOS app using xcodebuild and installs it directly to a USB-connected iPhone. This is the fastest way to test on real hardware during development, taking only 8-10 seconds vs TestFlight's longer review process.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when the user:
- Asks to "deploy to iPhone"
- Wants to "install the app on device"
- Says "build and deploy"
- Mentions testing on physical iPhone
- Wants to "push to device"

## Prerequisites

- iPhone connected via USB
- Device trusted (user tapped "Trust This Computer" on iPhone)
- Developer Mode enabled (Settings → Privacy & Security → Developer Mode)
- Valid code signing identity configured
- The project must be in an iOS app directory with .xcodeproj

## Instructions

1. Navigate to the iOS app directory (look for .xcodeproj file):
   ```bash
   cd path/to/ios/app
   ```

2. Run the install-device.sh script:
   ```bash
   ./install-device.sh
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Auto-detect the connected iPhone
   - Build the app with xcodebuild (using LD="clang" workaround)
   - Install the .app to the device
   - Report success

4. After successful installation, automatically start the app:
   ```bash
   ./restart-app.sh
   ```

5. Inform the user:
   - The build typically takes 8-10 seconds
   - The app will be automatically launched on the iPhone
   - If errors occur, check that iPhone is properly connected and trusted

## Expected Output

```
📱 Installing NoobTest directly to connected device...
✅ Found device: ashphone16
   Device ID: 00008140-0001684124A2201C
🔨 Building...
✅ Build complete
📲 Installing to device...
🎉 Installation complete!
🔄 Restarting NoobTest on device...
✅ App restarted
The app is now running on your iPhone.
```

## Common Issues

**No device detected**:
- Check USB connection
- Ensure "Trust This Computer" was accepted on iPhone
- Enable Developer Mode in Settings
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting

**Build fails with linker error**:
- Script uses `LD="clang"` to avoid Homebrew linker conflicts
- This is automatically handled

**Script hangs during build or install**:
- **Most common cause**: VPN is enabled on the Mac
- If the install-device.sh script hangs and doesn't complete:
  1. Ask the user: "Is your VPN currently enabled? If so, please disable it and try again."
  2. Wait for user to disable VPN
  3. Retry the deployment
- This happens because VPN can interfere with USB device communication
- After disabling VPN, the deployment should complete normally

## Implementation Details

The script:
- Uses `xcodebuild -showdestinations` to find the device ID
- Builds with `-allowProvisioningUpdates` for automatic code signing
- Finds the built .app in DerivedData by modification time
- Uses `xcrun devicectl device install app` to deploy

## Platform-Specific Notes

This is an iOS-specific skill. For Android/e/OS deployment, use a different approach.
