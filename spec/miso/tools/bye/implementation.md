# implementation
*use applescript to make this work*

Implement as AppleScript that:

1. Finds the frontmost application (should be Claude Code or Terminal)
2. Selects all content (Cmd-A), waits briefly for selection
3. Copies to clipboard (Cmd-C), waits for copy to complete
4. Creates chat directory if needed
5. Finds next available chat number (chat-001.md, chat-002.md, etc.)
6. Saves clipboard contents to new chat file
7. Clears selection with down arrow
8. Reports success

Handle timing issues and ensure proper application targeting.
