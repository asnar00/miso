# snippets
*snippet conventions*

We refer to *features* and *snippets* interchangeably, by name, eg. `miso`, `miso\snippets`.

## storage

The snippet `A` is stored as `spec/A.md`; 
the snippet `A/B` is stored as `spec/A/B.md`; 
the snippet `A/B/C` is stored as `spec/A/B/C.md`;

and so on.

## conventions

Snippets always start with a '#' title, followed by an *emphasized* single line summary.
Snippets are usually short, around 250-300 words max. The goal is to be concise, precise, and memorable.
Snippet titles and headings are lowercase.
