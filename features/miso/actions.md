# actions
*instructions that can be followed by people or agents*

*Actions* tell us how to achieve particular tasks; unlike tools, they are not directly executable. Instead, they are bullet-lists of instructions that can be followed by people or agents.

Instructions should be followed as precisely as possible, but should always be adapted to the current situation.
