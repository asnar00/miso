# tools
*small pieces of runnable code*

*Tools* are small pieces of runnable code designed to perform repeatable tasks. They generally do not call out to external APIs or agents, although they can run LLMs internally. The key is that they do the same thing every time.

The goal of `miso` is to help users write and maintain their own tools, while using them to get stuff done.
