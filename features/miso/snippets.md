# snippets
*how programs are represented*

`miso` represents programs as a tree of feature snippets - small natural-language markdown documents describing functionality.

To add detail, we generally refrain from editing a snippet; instead, we add child snippets that specify the detail.

Snippets should start with a '#' title, followed by an *emphasized* single-line summary, and keep content length below 300 words.

Snippets should be written in a style that the user understands.

To keep things easy to remember, we try to restrict the number of child snippets to four.
