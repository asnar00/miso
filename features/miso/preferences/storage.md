*where files should go*

A snippet `A/B/C` ("subfeature C of subfeature B of feature A") goes in the file `project/A/B/C.md`; its subfeatures go in the folder `project/A/B/C/`; and so on.

Meta-information, including code, goes in the snippet's *meta-folder*: `project/A/B/~C/`.

Code and notes for a specific implementation (eg. `py` or `macos`) of a feature go into an implementation-specific `code` folder inside the metafolder, eg. `project/A/B/~C/code/py/`.
