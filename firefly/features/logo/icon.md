# App Icon
*Visual branding for the Firefly application*

The Firefly app uses the nøøb character (ᕦ(ツ)ᕤ) as its app icon on device home screens.

The icon design is minimalist and distinctive: the black nøøb character on a solid turquoise background. This creates a playful, energetic, and friendly visual identity that's instantly recognizable.

Each platform (iOS and Android) requires multiple icon sizes for different contexts (app store, home screen, settings, notifications). The icon assets are generated from a master design and placed in platform-specific asset folders.

The nøøb character provides consistent branding across the app icon, in-app logo display, and marketing materials.
