*Displaying the nøøb character*

The Firefly app displays the nøøb character (ᕦ(ツ)ᕤ) prominently in the center of the main screen.

The character is rendered as plain text in a large, bold font with black color. This creates a simple, distinctive visual identity that reinforces the playful branding established by the app icon.

The nøøb character consists of three Unicode characters: flexed arms (from Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics) surrounding a happy face (from Katakana). Together they create the iconic "strong and happy" symbol that represents Firefly.
