# products
*runnable applications assembled from features*

While *features* describe specific features and the code needed to implement them, *products* are actual executable programs assembled from a subset of features.

Each product integrates code from multiple features. A mobile app might combine login, profile, messaging, and notifications features into one executable application.

Products follow the same convention as features (trees of markdown files) but their `imp` folders contain actual executables.
