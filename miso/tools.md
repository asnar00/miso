# tools
*executable code tools*

*Tools* are small programs that can be invoked from the command line (or from an agent terminal).

Tools can be command-line utilities, or interactive applications.

A tool can have multiple implementations for different platforms.

Tools are not allowed to invoke external APIs or agents, but they can be invoke by agents.
