# storage
*where snippets and meta-data are stored*

Snippets are referred to using a *path*, eg. `A/B` means "the subfeature B of feature A".

The snippet `A/B/C` is stored in the file `A/B/C.md`.

If the snippet defines a type of object, a list of available objects can be found in `A/B/C~/`.

Meta-information connected to the snippet itself, such as tracking data, code, agent notes and so on, should be stored in the snippet's *metafolder*: `A/B/~C/`
