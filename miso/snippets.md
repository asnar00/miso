# snippets
*small natural-language specifications*

A `snippet` is a small natural-language markdown document (like this one!) describing something about the system.

All snippets should start with a `#` title followed by an *emphasized* single-line summary.

Content should be under 300 words, use words you can understand, and be as terse as possible.

To add detail to a snippet, you create *child snippets* and put the detail in there.

To make things easier to remember, a snippet may have a maximum of six children.

Snippets can refer to other snippets using `soft links` which resolve through semantic search.
