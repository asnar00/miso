*how miso represents programss*

*Feature-modular specifications* represent programs as *snippet trees*.

A *snippet* is a short (<300 words) natural-language description of a program feature, written for and by users.

To add detail to a snippet, we create a *sub-snippet* that defines the additional detail; we don't edit the parent snippet.

To keep things easy to remember, snippets may have up to six sub-snippets; four is encouraged.

Snippets can refer to other snippets using `soft links` - semantic search terms that resolve to one or more other snippets.
