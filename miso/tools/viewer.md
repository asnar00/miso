# viewer
*explore and view snippet trees*

The `viewer` is a narrow column at the left of the screen, leaving plenty of space to view the user's application.

It contains a "breadcrumbs* navigator, a properly formatted "preview" rendering of the snippet markdown content, and a list of clickable children (title and summary).
