# actions
*specific actions, and how to perform them*

*Actions* are specific user or system tasks, specified as step-by-step bullet-point natural-language instructions.

Actions can be followed by people, or by agents, or by groups of people and agents. 

When following instructions, you should be flexible and adapt to specific conditions, and check with collaborators when unsure.

Actions can "call" specific actions by enclosing the invocation in `inline-code`.
