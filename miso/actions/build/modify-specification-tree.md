# modify-specification-tree
*update specifications based on implementation learnings*

Use all approaches together for comprehensive spec maintenance:

**Reactive updates**: When implementation reveals problems or gaps in the original specification, update the snippet to be clearer or more complete.

**Proactive enhancement**: As implementation proceeds, improve specs with useful details and examples that will help future builds.

**Separate documentation**: Keep tool specs focused on "what", while platform knowledge captures implementation details about "how".

**Bidirectional sync**: Maintain the cycle where specifications inform implementation, and implementation experience improves specifications.

Document what changes were made and why in the build report, so the evolution of specs is transparent.
