# fix-bugs
*resolve issues until the tool works correctly*

Follow these steps in order:

**Collaborative debugging**: Work with user to identify and understand the problem. Share error messages, unexpected behavior, and gather context.

**Platform-specific troubleshooting**: Apply platform knowledge to diagnose the issue. Check common problems documented in platform snippets.

**Iterative testing**: Implement fixes and test immediately. Repeat the build-test-fix cycle until the tool works as specified.

**Documentation of solutions**: Record the fix in appropriate platform snippets so future builds can avoid the same issues.

Keep the user involved throughout - they know when the tool is working correctly.
