# create-implementation-plan
*design the step-by-step approach to building the tool*

Use all planning approaches together:

**Dependency mapping**: Identify what needs to be built in what order - libraries before executables, base components before derived ones.

**Platform-specific workflows**: Apply platform knowledge to create appropriate build steps (e.g., for macOS: create Xcode project, modify Swift files, build via AppleScript).

**Sequential steps**: Break down into ordered, specific tasks that can be tracked and checked off during implementation.

**Adaptive planning**: Start with a solid plan but expect to modify it as implementation reveals new requirements or challenges.

Document the plan before starting, but update it as needed during the build process.
