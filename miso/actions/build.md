# build
*converts a tool spec into running code*

- detect which snippets and therefore tools have changed
- assemble relevant snippets into a single context
- select an implementation platform (if not obvious)
- resolve ambiguity and uncertainty
- create an implementation plan
- generate and modify code as needed
- fix bugs (with user) until user is happy
- modify the specification tree if necessary
- clean up temporary files
- make a report of what was done
