definitely needs to be some work on "visibility"
-> seeing what the browser is doing
-> seeing console
-> seeing what a server is doing
-> etc.

-----------------------------------

first experiment failed: because "build" isn't a tool.
It SHOULD have made it call out to some agent stuff.
But it didn't. So we have to try again.

I wonder if we can self-critique... but can't be arsed.
Let's try again tomorrow.

-----------------------------------

"actions" - how to do things, step by step.
also a tree.

I guess we could also make "plans" for doing stuff.

They're all tree-docs.

-------------------------------------

ChatGPT much more verbose and "clever" than Claude, I don't understand it half the time.

Needs to be a firm boundary between "what the user wrote" and "what the agent wrote".

Maybe even something like "all agent-written files should be named starting with `~`"
