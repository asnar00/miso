possible next steps:

- recordability / reproducibility / understandability
- unified capture-app for iphone/android
- record video into a circular buffer
- record system state at regular intervals (same interval)
- when there's a problem, just save the current log as a "trace"
- ability to get screenshot into agent
- agent can rewind, fwd through a trace
- replicate the system state, calls, etc.

=> that's a damn good way to get things going.

I really like this approach - just got to make the build parallel.
make the app "understandable" - "seeable"
