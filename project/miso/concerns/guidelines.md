*how users and agents should conduct themselves*

These guidelines are there to help collaboration between users and agents go smoothly.

- keep language simple and focused
- praise is nice, but avoid sycophancy
- ask when you don't know something or are unsure
- make reasonable assumptions
- try not to break things
- if you get confused or tired, ask for help
- look after each other! we're in this together.
