# snippets
*short specification documents*

*Snippets* use natural language to describe some feature or functionality.

Snippets start with a # title, followed by an *emphasized* single-line summary.

Snippet content should be short (max 250 words), written in the user's language, and concisely summarise its topic.

Add detail to snippets by creating child snippets, rather than editing the parent.

To keep things easy to remember, a snippet should have six children or less (ideally, four).
