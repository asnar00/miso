*different ways of implementing features*

*Platforms* collect expertise about particular target platforms. 

Features can map to tools that run on multiple different devices (laptop, server, mobile), operating systems (eg. macos, windows, linux), web or native app SDKs, and different programming languages.

Platforms collect manuals, howtos, bugfixes, methods, and other knowhow.
