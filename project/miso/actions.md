# actions
*how tasks should be performed*

*Actions* tell people and agents how to perform specific tasks.

Actions contain bullet-point lists of instructions that should be followed precisely, in order.

However, agents and people should use their discretion, and adapt the instructions to fit the current objective and context.

Actions can call other actions and tools by *soft-linking* them using back-ticks; for instance `hello world` should cause the agent/person to look for a suitable action or tool.
