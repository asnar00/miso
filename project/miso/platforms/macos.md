*native apple applications*

Use template projects created by xcode instead of constructing from scratch. Ask the user to build a project if you don't have one.

Use OSA commands to xcode to build or stop an application, rather than building from the command line.

Use OSAscript messages to apps to control them.

Use self-built logging to files rather than system logs.
