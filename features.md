# features
*basic concepts*

`miso` represents programs as *feature trees*.

A *feature* is a short (<300 words) natural-language description of a program feature, written for and by users.

To add detail to a feature, we create a *sub-feature* that defines the additional detail; we don't edit the parent feature.

To keep things easy to remember, features may have up to six sub-features; four is encouraged.
