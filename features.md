# features
*basic concepts*

*Feature-modular specifications* represent programs as *feature trees*.

A *feature* is a short (<300 words) natural-language description of a program feature, written for and by users.

To add detail to a feature, we create a *sub-feature* that defines the additional detail; we don't edit the parent feature.

To keep things easy to remember, features may have up to six sub-features; four is encouraged.

Features whose name starts with "~" are disabled. If you have an idea for a feature that you're not sure about, create a disabled feature and sketch it out.
